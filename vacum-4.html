             <p>
The Milex Power Airfryer 3.6L is the latest seven-in-one, 3.6-litre capacity Airfryer in the Milex product range.

The Power Airfryer’s secret is in its Rapid Hot Air Technology which allows you to cook healthier versions of your favourite fried foods with little-to-no oil and in next-to-no time!

Your meals are cooked in a whirlwind of superheated air - a quicker, easier and cleaner alternative to a deep-fat fryer or conventional oven.

Air-fry, grill, bake, sauté and roast without sacrificing the taste and texture!

All these functions are now available in one sleek and compact device. And it couldn’t be easier to use - simply add your food to the Non-Stick Easy-Load Fry Basket, slide it into the unit, and with the touch of a button, select one of seven pre-programmed cooking functions or manually adjust the timer and temperature settings.

The state of the art digital touchscreen control panel eliminates the guesswork and ensures that whatever you cook comes out perfectly delicious and crispy time after time.
